## About
This game is based on Zork, which of course implies that:
* It is an interactive fiction game
* It has got a map of interconnecting rooms / areas
* The user controls a PC that moves within that map
* It has NPCs that interact with your PC

For a lot more information, a list of commands and all you can take a look at the wiki:

## Play with colors
The game experience is nicer when playing with colors.
This is how it looks:

If you don't have ANSI escape code support, you can install the wonderful **ANSICON** library from:

http://adoxa.altervista.org/ansicon/   
or

## Play in black and white
There is an option to play without colors, with the argument -nocolor:
* zork -nocolor

## How to finish the game
**Warning: Spoilers ahead!!**
Basically it is an open world, but the key actions to be taken to beat the game are:
* Get the key to the Security Room by defeating the TROLL in Cell No. 3
* Go to the OFFICE room upstairs and when prompted enter QUIT
